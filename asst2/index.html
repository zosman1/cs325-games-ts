<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?

The game plays slightly like breakout except it has multiple balls, forcing the player to think more than one move ahead.

</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?

I was able to add 100 balls into the renderer without it lagging.
To detect if a ball went into the bottom of the screen, the original 
way I was planning is to loop through all 100 balls but doing this on 
every frame update might have been too laggy, instead I was able to 
reduce it to looping through the 10 balls that might be "active" at the time
thus saving cpu cycles and render time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?

I learned that handling multiple sprites at once is not too easy in phaser.
The hardest part was figuring out a way to not loop through all the balls to detect if one went past the boundaries.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.


All assets i made from scratch using GIMP
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?

I want the player to have trouble beating this game but eventually figure it out
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, 
the system dynamics, and the core mechanic.
 Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s 
 inputs and their expected effects (how to play). Y
 ou can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. 
 You may include mock-up images for parts of the game 
 not in the prototype.

 The player can only move the paddle left and right,
 you're goal is to prevent the balls from hitting the oasis
 The gameplay aspect is pretty much done however one thing
 i'd want to add to is a better ball hit system, as i wasn't able to get it feeling perfect.

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?

Thinking a few moves ahead is required in this game as you can't win otherwise.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. 
What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? 
Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. 
If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?

The world is in peril, our last water source is this oasis that is under threat by alien attack, save the worlds last water soruce by deflecting the balls of doom!

</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.

I'm trying to reach a small audience that wants a fun, quick, and difficult arcade game to play
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?


20 seconds or less.
